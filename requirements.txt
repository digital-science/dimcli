#
# IMPORTANT NOTE 
#
#
# The CLI **requires** higher versions of ipython and prompt-toolkit: 
#
# ipython>=7.2.0
# prompt-toolkit>=2.0.9
#
# These can be upgraded on demand by users who need the Query Console functionalities. 
# They are not added by default so to ensure Dimcli can also work as a 
# standalone Python library within Google Colab and Conda. 
# Normally these environments are running older versions of the libraries, eg in Colab:
#
# ipython                  5.5.0  
# prompt-toolkit           1.0.16 
#
